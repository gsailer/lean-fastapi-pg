# Lean FastAPI Alembic

When I looked for cookiecutter templates with FastAPI all templates I found seemed bloated to me. This is an attempt at a more minimal template to get started with a FastAPI + PostgreSQL application.

This template features:

- basic fastapi setup with subrouters
- Alembic setup
- docker-compose for db, api and migrations
